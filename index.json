This model has been trained on a vast amount of data, allowing it to generate text that is coherent, relevant, and natural-sounding. ChatGPT is a significant advancement in the field of natural language processing, and has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of applications.\nOne of the key capabilities of ChatGPT is its ability to continue a conversation in a natural and coherent way. This makes it well-suited for use in customer service chatbots, where it can provide answers to questions and engage in back-and-forth conversation with users. In addition to its conversational abilities, ChatGPT is also capable of generating text that is relevant to the topic at hand, making it a valuable tool for content generation.\nWhat makes chatGPT unique? One of the key differences between ChatGPT and other language models is its ability to continue a conversation in a natural and coherent way. Many language models are trained on a large amount of data, but they are not designed to generate text that flows naturally in a conversation. ChatGPT, on the other hand, has been specifically designed to generate text that is coherent and relevant to the ongoing conversation, allowing it to engage in back-and-forth dialogue with users.\nAdditionally, ChatGPT is capable of generating text that is relevant to the topic at hand. This makes it well-suited for use in applications such as content generation, where it can produce text that is both relevant and engaging. Other language models may be able to generate text, but they may not be able to generate text that is specifically relevant to a given topic or context.\nHow does chatGPT work? ChatGPT is a large language model that has been trained on a vast amount of data. This training allows ChatGPT to generate text that is coherent, relevant, and natural-sounding. When given a prompt, ChatGPT uses its understanding of language and its knowledge of the training data to generate text that is appropriate for the context and the topic at hand.\nIn order to generate text that is coherent and natural-sounding, ChatGPT uses a technique called “transformer architecture”. This allows the model to consider the entire context of the conversation or text, rather than just the individual words or sentences. This allows ChatGPT to generate text that flows naturally and makes sense in the context of the conversation. Additionally, ChatGPT uses a technique called “attention mechanism” to focus on the most relevant parts of the input text, allowing it to generate text that is relevant and on-topic.\nPhoto by Soly Moses Potential Applications ChatGPT has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of applications, thanks to its ability to generate human-like text that is coherent, relevant, and natural-sounding. Some of the possible ways in which ChatGPT can be used include:\nCustomer service: ChatGPT can be used in customer service chatbots to provide answers to questions and engage in back-and-forth conversation with users. This can improve the user experience by providing quick and accurate answers, and can also free up human customer service agents to focus on more complex tasks.\nContent generation: ChatGPT can be used to generate text for a variety of purposes, such as creating social media posts, website content, or articles. This can save time and effort for content creators, and can also produce high-quality, engaging text that is relevant to the topic at hand.\nLanguage translation: ChatGPT can be used to improve the accuracy and fluency of machine translation systems. By generating text that is coherent and natural-sounding, ChatGPT can help machine translation systems produce translations that are more accurate and easier to understand.\nOther: ChatGPT can also be used in a variety of other applications, such as voice assistants, virtual assistants, and conversational interfaces. Its ability to generate human-like text makes it a valuable tool for any application that involves natural language processing.\nPhoto by MART PRODUCTION ChatGPT in action Customer Support Example of customer support - random user looking for shoes:\nUser: Hi, I\u0026#39;m looking for a new pair of running shoes. Can you help me find the right ones?\nChatGPT: Hi there! I\u0026#39;d be happy to help you find the right running shoes. What type of shoes are you looking for?\nUser: I want something that has good support and cushioning\nChatGPT: Based on your requirements, I would recommend the Nike Zoom Pegasus Turbo 2. This shoe is designed for high-mileage runners and provides excellent support and cushioning.\nUser: That sounds perfect! How much do they cost?\nChatGPT: The Nike Zoom Pegasus Turbo 2 has a retail price of $180. You may be able to find them for less at certain retailers or during sales.\nUser: Thanks for your help!\nChatGPT: You\u0026#39;re welcome!

This change is perhaps one of the most impactful ones since the industrial revolution and has the potential to reshape the industry by itself. The key factor behind this change is the currency of the new world – Data. It is incomprehensible to the mainstream that in how many different ways we can use data to harness the power of state-of-the-art techniques of Machine Learning. The scope and opportunity of adopting these ideas are no more limited to researchers and experts only. As an Engineer, it has become mandatory to keep up to date with the role of AI in countless engineering applications and be able to use it to our benefit in every possible way.

Health care, education, security, transportation, warfare, entertainment – the list goes on. Inconspicuous to many, state-of-the-art techniques of Signal Processing remains key to this drastic and rapid shift in the industry. Commensurate with the challenging paradigms of the recent times, IEEE Signal Processing Society has been arranging different SP competitions at regular intervals for a while now. Notable such two competitions open to undergraduate students are the IEEE Signal Processing Cup (SP Cup) and the IEEE Video and Image Processing Cup (VIP Cup). IEEE SPS has successfully organized six iterations of the IEEE SP Cup since 2014 and three iterations of the IEEE VIP Cup since 2017. Problems in the past competitions have involved a wide range of signal processing challenges like Image Restoration, Heart Rate Monitoring, Location Forensics, Beat tracking, Image Forensics, Source localization, Traffic Sign Recognition, Lung Tumor Radiomics, Activity Recognition etc. These competitions provide an excellent opportunity for undergraduate students to fast track their skills and experience in the relevant fields. Every year, top three teams of these competitions are rewarded and invited to prestigious international conferences to compete for the final round of the competition. It is a matter of great pride that Bangladeshi students have dominated these competitions since the very beginning. This event aims to bring firsthand experience from SP Cup and VIP Cup to aspiring undergraduate students and provide them guidance on how they can better prepare themselves for these challenges.
